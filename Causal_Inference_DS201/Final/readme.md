# Assessing the Impact of Compulsory Licensing on U.S. Innovation ðŸ“Š

## Overview
In this project,  completed as part of my Causal Inference coursework at `New York University`ï¼Œ I replicated and analyzed the findings from Moser and Voenaâ€™s 2012 American Economic Review paper, which explores the effects of the World War I Trading with the Enemy Act on U.S. domestic innovation. The policy of compulsory licensing allowed U.S. firms to produce foreign-owned inventions, particularly from Germany, without consent from patent holders. This research focuses on its impact in the organic chemicals sector, revealing a significant increase in domestic patenting activity as U.S. firms took advantage of foreign intellectual property. Difference-in-Differences analysis indicates a 20% increase in domestic invention as a result of the policy, highlighting the transformative role of compulsory licensing on innovation during that period.


## Objectives
- Replicate the analysis from Moser and Voena (2012) to assess how the Trading with the Enemy Act affected patenting activity.
- Use Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimation to evaluate the treatment effect of compulsory licensing on U.S. domestic invention.
- Conduct robustness checks to validate results and ensure accurate identification of the treatment effect.

## Data Description
The dataset consists of 471,120 observations representing U.S. Patent Office sub-classes over 65 years. Key variables include:
- USPTO Class (uspto_class): Identifies each patent sub-class.
- Grant Year (grntyr): Year in which patents were granted.
- Count of U.S. Patents (count_usa): Number of patents granted to U.S.-owned firms.
- Count of Foreign Patents (count_for): Number of patents granted to foreign-owned firms.
- Treatment Indicator (treat): Binary indicator of whether a sub-class received compulsory licensing post-1918.

## Methods and Technologies
- Difference-in-Differences (DiD): Used to estimate the average treatment effect of compulsory licensing by comparing patent activity in treated vs. untreated patent sub-classes before and after the 1918 implementation of the Trading with the Enemy Act.
- Data Aggregation and Analysis: Aggregated data using tidyverse and applied lm_robust for estimation.
- Robustness Checks: Additional stratified DiD analysis to validate the treatment effect, addressing concerns over parallel trends.

## Analysis Steps
- Data Aggregation: The dataset was aggregated by USPTO patent sub-class, grouping patent counts into pre-treatment (1875-1918) and post-treatment (1919-1939) periods.
- Difference-in-Differences Estimation: Calculated the difference in patent counts between treated and untreated groups, yielding a 25.53% increase in patent activity among treated sub-classes.
- Robustness Checks: Performed stratified analysis to confirm the reliability of the results and ensure parallel trends hold in the pre-treatment period.

## Result
- Patent Activity Increase: The Difference-in-Differences estimation found a 25.53% increase in patenting activity in treated sub-classes, suggesting that compulsory licensing positively influenced domestic innovation.
- Confidence Interval: The results were statistically significant at the 95% confidence interval (CI: 0.1814, 0.3292), confirming the robustness of the treatment effect.
- Validation: Stratified DiD analysis further confirmed the validity of the parallel trends assumption and supported the overall findings.

## Key Findings
- Impact on Innovation: Compulsory licensing under the Trading with the Enemy Act had a significant positive effect on U.S. innovation, particularly in the organic chemicals sector.
- Robustness of Results: The stratified DiD checks corroborate the findings, indicating that the policy allowed domestic firms to innovate by using formerly restricted foreign patents.

## Conclusion
This project successfully replicates and builds upon Moser and Voenaâ€™s (2012) analysis, demonstrating how the Trading with the Enemy Act and compulsory licensing policies encouraged domestic innovation in the U.S. Using Difference-in-Differences techniques, the project identifies a significant increase in patenting activity, highlighting the role of policy in shaping technological advancement.
