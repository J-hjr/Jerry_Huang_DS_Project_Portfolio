## Background

This project aims to enhance the user experience and satisfaction in news reading by developing a personalized news recommendation system. With the vast amount of news content available online, users often struggle to find news that is relevant to their interests. Therefore, building an efficient and accurate news recommendation system is crucial for improving user engagement and loyalty.

To address this challenge, a news recommendation system challenge was organized. The challenge provided participants with a dataset of real user browsing behavior, including the text content, timestamp, and category of news articles. 

The data comes from the user interaction data of a news APP platform, including 300,000 users, nearly 3 million clicks, and more than 360,000 different news articles, each of which has a corresponding embedding vector representation. In order to ensure the fairness of the competition, the click log data of 200,000 users is selected as the training set, the click log data of 50,000 users is selected as Test Set A, and the click log data of another 50,000 users is selected as Test Set B.

### Goal

The core purpose of building a news recommendation system is to improve the user reading experience and satisfaction. With the explosive growth of news content on the internet, users often struggle to find news articles that are relevant to their interests, and may even waste time reading many irrelevant or uninteresting articles. Therefore, providing personalized and accurate news recommendation services to users can increase their loyalty and engagement with news content, while also improving the user retention and profitability of news media.

To provide a more detailed explanation, many news media websites and applications now offer news recommendation services that use artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to analyze user browsing history, interests, and behaviors in order to recommend news articles that best match their interests and preferences. Here are a few examples:

- Suppose a user frequently browses and clicks on sports news articles. The news recommendation system may then recommend more sports-related articles based on this information, such as the latest football match reports or news about sports stars. This makes it easier for users to find the content that they are interested in, improving their satisfaction and loyalty.
- Another example is that if a user consistently browses health and wellness articles, the news recommendation system may recommend more articles related to health, nutrition, and wellness. This enables users to easily find the information they need, while also learning more about health and wellness.

Through these examples, we can see that the core purpose of a news recommendation system is to provide personalized and accurate news recommendation services to users in order to improve their reading experience and satisfaction, while also increasing user traffic and revenue for news media.

### Challenge

The implementation of a news recommendation system can pose a number of challenges, some of which are:

1. **Data sparsity and cold start problem**: The data collected about users' browsing history and preferences is often sparse and incomplete, making it difficult to accurately determine their interests and make personalized recommendations. Additionally, for new users who have no browsing history, there is no data to use to generate recommendations, which can make it difficult to create personalized experiences for these users.
2. **Real-time recommendations**: News content is often updated frequently, and users expect to see new and relevant articles as soon as they are published. Therefore, recommendation algorithms must be able to work in real-time and quickly adapt to changing user interests and new articles.
3. **Scalability and performance**: As the amount of data and the number of users grows, recommendation algorithms must be able to scale efficiently and handle large amounts of data in real-time. This requires careful design and implementation of data storage and retrieval mechanisms, as well as high-performance algorithms that can handle large-scale data processing.
4. **Privacy and ethical concerns**: Collecting user data to make personalized recommendations can raise privacy and ethical concerns, especially if users are not aware of how their data is being used or if it is being shared with third parties without their consent. Therefore, it is important for news media companies to be transparent about their data collection and usage practices, and to ensure that user data is kept secure and private.
5. **Algorithm bias**: News recommendation algorithms may sometimes exhibit bias based on the data they are trained on or the assumptions built into their design. This can result in recommendations that are inaccurate or unfairly discriminatory, and can lead to negative consequences for users and the news media companies that use these algorithms. Therefore, it is important to carefully design and evaluate recommendation algorithms to minimize the potential for bias and ensure fair and accurate recommendations for all users.

Overall, the challenges of implementing a news recommendation system require a combination of technical expertise, careful planning, and ethical considerations. By addressing these challenges, news media companies can provide personalized and engaging experiences for their users while also ensuring the privacy and security of user data.

### Opportunity

1. **Personalization**: News recommendation systems can provide a personalized experience for users by tailoring recommendations to their interests, preferences, and browsing history. This can increase user engagement and satisfaction, leading to increased traffic and revenue for news media companies.
2. **Increased User Retention**: By providing personalized and relevant recommendations, news recommendation systems can increase user retention and loyalty, leading to a more engaged and loyal user base.
3. **Monetization**: News media companies can use recommendation systems to generate additional revenue through targeted advertising and content promotion.
4. **Improved User Experience**: By providing personalized and relevant recommendations, news recommendation systems can improve the overall user experience by making it easier for users to discover new content that is of interest to them.
5. **Better Understanding of User Behavior**: By analyzing user data, news recommendation systems can provide valuable insights into user behavior, preferences, and interests. This can help news media companies to better understand their audience and create more targeted content and marketing strategies.

### Datasets

### Evaluation

The evaluation metric for news recommendation systems is MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank). For each user in the test set, a score is calculated based on the predicted ranking of news articles. The score is calculated as follows:

$$score(user) = \sum_{k=1}^5 \frac{s(user, k)}{k}$$

where rank(user) is the position of the first article clicked by the user in the predicted ranking. If the predicted ranking hits the user's last click, the rank(user) is 5; otherwise, it equals the number of unclicked articles plus 1.

The final score for a team is the average score over all users in the test set.

Regarding the evaluation metric, if the clicked article is the first predicted result, then $s(user,k)=1$ for k=1 and $s(user,k)=0$ for k=2 to 5. If the clicked article is not the first predicted result but appears in the top 5 recommendations, then $s(user,k)=1/k$, where k is the position of the clicked article in the top 5 recommendations. If the clicked article does not appear in the top 5 recommendations, then s(user,k)=0 for k=1 to 5. The score of a user is the average of all the s(user,k) values for that user.

The purpose of the competition is to develop a news recommendation system that can accurately predict the articles that a user is interested in based on their past click behavior.

The **MRR** evaluation metric has several **benefits** for news recommendation systems.

Firstly, it considers the rank of the first clicked article for each user, which reflects the importance of presenting relevant news articles at the top of the recommendation list. This is critical for keeping users engaged and increasing their satisfaction with the recommendation system.

Secondly, the reciprocal nature of the metric gives equal weight to all clicked articles, regardless of their position in the predicted ranking. This means that the evaluation is more focused on the relevance of the recommended articles, rather than the overall ranking of the list.

## Key Steps

1. Data preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing the collected data, such as removing duplicates, filling in missing values, and transforming data into a suitable format.

2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Exploring the data to gain insights and identify patterns or anomalies that could be relevant to the recommendation task.
3. Feature engineering: Selecting or creating appropriate features from the data to represent user and item characteristics that are relevant to the recommendation task.
4. Model development: Developing a recommendation algorithm or model that can learn from the selected features and make predictions or recommendations.
5. Model evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the developed model using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or ranking-based metrics.
6. Model optimization: Tuning or optimizing the model to improve its performance, often by adjusting hyperparameters or incorporating new features.
7. Deployment and monitoring: Deploying the final model in a production environment and monitoring its performance over time, often using A/B testing or other experimental techniques.

### Data Analysis

1. The user IDs in the training set and test set are not duplicated, meaning the user model in the test set has not been seen before.
2. The minimum number of clicks for a user in the training set is 2, while in the test set it is 1.
3. Users may click on the same article multiple times, but this only occurs in the training set.
4. There is variability in the number of times users click on articles, which can be used to create features to measure user activity.
5. There is also variability in the number of times articles are clicked on, which can be used to create features to measure article popularity.
6. The relevance of articles to users is usually strong, so predicting whether a user is interested in an article is often related to their history of clicking on articles.
7. There are differences in the length of articles that users click on, which can reflect their preferences for article length.
8. Users also have different preferences for the topics of articles they click on, which can be reflected in features related to their topic preferences.
9. The time intervals between when different users click on articles may also vary, reflecting differences in their preferences for article timeliness.

### Multiple Recall

### item-cf

#### Description

Item Collaborative Filtering (item-cf) is a popular recommendation algorithm that is based on the similarity between items. It recommends items to users by identifying the items that are similar to the ones they have liked or interacted with in the past.

#### Core principle

The core principle of item-cf is to calculate the similarity between items based on the historical interaction data of users. This is done by constructing an item-item similarity matrix, which stores the similarity scores between all pairs of items in the system. The similarity score between two items is calculated based on the number of users who have interacted with both items.

#### Considerations

One important consideration in item-cf is the **sparsity** of the user-item interaction matrix. Since most users only interact with a small subset of items in the system, the similarity scores between items may not be accurate or reliable. Therefore, techniques such as data normalization, feature weighting, and matrix factorization may be used to improve the performance of the algorithm.

#### Pros & Cons

One advantage of item-cf is its simplicity and efficiency. It is easy to implement and can handle large datasets with millions of items and users. Additionally, it does not require any user or item features, making it a versatile algorithm for a wide range of recommendation scenarios.

However, item-cf has several limitations. It suffers from the well-known cold start problem, where it cannot recommend items to new users or items with no historical interaction data. Additionally, it may suffer from the popularity bias problem, where it tends to recommend popular items to all users, leading to a lack of diversity in recommendations. Finally, it is not suitable for recommending items that are outside the user's historical preferences or that require a higher level of personalization.

### user-cf

#### Description

User-based Collaborative Filtering (User CF) is a type of recommendation algorithm that is based on the idea that users who have similar preferences in the past will have similar preferences in the future. User CF finds similar users to a target user and recommends items that those similar users have liked or rated positively.

#### Core principle

The core principle of User CF is to compute the similarity between users based on their past interactions with items. This can be done using various similarity measures, such as cosine similarity or Pearson correlation coefficient. Once the similarity between the target user and other users is calculated, the system will recommend items that those similar users have interacted with in the past but the target user has not.

#### Considerations

- User CF may suffer from the sparsity problem, as the number of users who have interacted with a particular item may be small. This can lead to inaccurate recommendations.
- The quality of recommendations depends on the quality of the user-item interactions data. If the data is noisy or incomplete, the recommendations may be inaccurate.
- User CF may also suffer from the cold start problem, where new users do not have enough interaction data to make accurate recommendations.

#### Pros & Cons

Pros:

- User CF can provide personalized recommendations to users based on their past interactions.
- User CF does not require any information about the items being recommended, making it easy to implement and scalable.
- User CF can provide diverse recommendations, as it recommends items that have been liked by similar users who may have different tastes.

Cons:

- User CF may suffer from the sparsity problem, leading to inaccurate recommendations.
- User CF is prone to the popularity bias, where popular items are recommended more frequently than less popular items.
- User CF may not be able to capture long-term preferences or changes in user preferences over time.

</p>

#### Description

Youtube DNN recall is a recommendation algorithm used in the YouTube recommendation system. It is a deep neural network-based model that predicts the probability of a user engaging with a video based on their viewing history and other features.

#### Core principle

The core principle of Youtube DNN recall is to use deep learning models to learn the complex relationships between user behaviors and video features. It is a two-stage process. In the first stage, the model extracts features from user and video data using multiple layers of neural networks. In the second stage, it uses these features to predict the probability of user engagement with the video.

#### Considerations

- Training a deep neural network model requires a large amount of training data and significant computing resources.
- Due to the complexity of the model, the training process may take a long time.

</p>


#### Description

Dual Tower Recall is a recommendation algorithm that uses two parallel neural networks, one for the user and one for the item, to learn user-item interactions and generate recommendations.

#### Core principle

The Dual Tower Recall algorithm consists of two parallel neural networks: the User Tower and the Item Tower. The User Tower takes as input the user's historical interactions and encodes them into a fixed-length vector. Similarly, the Item Tower takes as input the item's metadata and encodes it into another fixed-length vector. The two vectors are then compared to generate a score that represents the predicted user-item interaction. The model is trained using a pairwise ranking loss function to optimize the ranking of positive and negative interactions.

#### Considerations

1. The quality and amount of input data have a significant impact on the performance of the algorithm.
2. The model may suffer from the cold-start problem, as it requires a certain amount of historical interaction data to generate recommendations.
3. The training process can be computationally expensive and time-consuming, especially for large datasets.

#### Pros & Cons

Pros:

1. Dual Tower Retrieval can capture complex user-item interactions and generate accurate recommendations.
2. It can handle both explicit and implicit feedback data.
3. It can incorporate various types of metadata information, such as user demographic information and item attributes, to improve recommendation quality.

Cons:

1. The algorithm requires a large amount of training data to perform well.
2. It may not be suitable for recommending niche or long-tail items with limited interaction data.
3. The training process can be computationally expensive and time-consuming.

## Feature Engineering



<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/datoujinggzj/DS_Project_Portfolio/assets/99417740/27f28afe-ca64-49fe-9b8a-219e06367a8e" alt="Image" width="400" height="230">
</p>


Some of the features that can be directly utilized from the given raw data include:

- User ID: each user in the dataset has a unique ID that can be used to identify the user.
- Article ID: each article also has a unique ID that can be used to identify the article.
- Click time: records the time when each user clicked on each article, which can be used to analyze user interest changes and temporal characteristics.
- Click count: records the number of times each user clicked on each article, which can be used to measure user interest in different articles and article popularity.
- Article category: some datasets provide category labels for each article, which can be used to analyze user interest and preferences for different article categories.
- Article keywords: some datasets provide keywords for each article, which can be used to analyze user interest and preferences for different article topics.
- User profile: some datasets provide basic user information and preference data, which can be used to analyze user interests and preferences.

Feature engineering is a crucial step in building a news recommendation system. Here are several aspects to consider when performing feature engineering:

### Article Features

Besides the inherent characteristics of an article, such as `category_id`, `created_at_ts`, and `words_count`, we can also extract text features from an article using NLP techniques. This can include features like the article's title, body, and keywords. We can use text preprocessing techniques like cleaning, tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming to process these text features. We can then use them to construct features like TF-IDF, bag-of-words, and n-gram features.

### User Features

We can construct user profiles based on their basic information and behavior data, such as their age, gender, occupation, education level, location, click history, collection history, purchase history, etc. We can combine, encode, and normalize these features to create a user feature vector.

### Contextual Features

To take into account the fact that users may have different interests and needs depending on the time, place, device, and environment, we can use contextual information to construct contextual features. For example, we can use the user's click time, click device, click location, and search history to create features like time series, geolocation, and device features.

### User-Article Interaction Features

We can use user-article interaction data to construct interaction features, such as which articles the user clicked on, how many times they clicked, the time interval between clicks, whether the user collected or shared the article, etc. These features can reflect the user's interests and behavior towards the article.

### Label Features

By using the user's click behavior as the label, we can predict the user's click behavior based on certain rules or machine learning algorithms, and create label features. These features can be used to train and evaluate supervised learning algorithms.

**Notes:**

When performing feature engineering, it's important to keep the following in mind:

- Feature selection: Select the most predictive features.
- Feature scaling: Scale features so that they have similar scales and prevent the model's performance from degrading due to differences in feature scales.
- Feature crossing: Cross different features to construct new features that can improve the model's generalization ability.
- Data sampling: Sample data to avoid imbalanced data issues.

## Data Modeling

### LGB Ranker
