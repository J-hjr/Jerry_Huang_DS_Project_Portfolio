Pokémon, short for "Pocket Monsters," is a globally popular media franchise created by Satoshi Tajiri and Ken Sugimori, and managed by The Pokémon Company, a collaboration between Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. Since its debut in 1996 with the release of Pokémon Red and Green (Blue outside Japan) for the Game Boy, Pokémon has become one of the most successful and beloved entertainment franchises in the world. The franchise includes video games, trading card games, an animated TV series, movies, toys, and merchandise.

The core concept of Pokémon revolves around capturing, training, and battling various fictional creatures known as "Pokémon." Players, known as Pokémon Trainers, travel through various regions to capture these creatures using Poké Balls, train them to battle against other Trainers' Pokémon, and strive to become the Pokémon Champion by defeating the Elite Four and the Pokémon League Champion.

## Background
The Pokémon universe is rich with lore, diverse species, and unique regions. Each Pokémon species has its own set of characteristics, including different types (such as Water, Fire, Grass), abilities, and stats (such as Attack, Defense, Speed). These attributes play a significant role in battles, influencing strategies and outcomes. Over the years, the Pokémon franchise has expanded to include over 800 species of Pokémon, each with its own set of evolutionary stages and special abilities.

The Pokémon games are known for their deep gameplay mechanics, which combine elements of strategy, role-playing, and collection. Players must carefully choose and train their Pokémon to create balanced teams that can adapt to various battle scenarios. The games also feature various in-game events, tournaments, and multiplayer modes that allow players to connect and compete with others worldwide.

In addition to video games, the Pokémon Trading Card Game (TCG) has also become a major aspect of the franchise, allowing fans to collect, trade, and battle with Pokémon cards. The TCG has a vibrant competitive scene, with tournaments held globally.

As a cultural phenomenon, Pokémon has left an indelible mark on popular culture, influencing multiple generations of fans and expanding into numerous forms of media and merchandise. With a fanbase spanning across the globe, Pokémon continues to evolve and captivate audiences of all ages.
