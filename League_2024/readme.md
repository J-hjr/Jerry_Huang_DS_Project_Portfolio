# League of Legends Champions 2024

## Project Objective

This project aims to analyze and explore various attributes of League of Legends champions using a dataset from Kaggle. The analysis is designed to help players, analysts, and developers gain insights into champion characteristics, roles in gameplay, and their overall mechanics. The data analysis provides a better understanding of key factors such as champion difficulty, resource types, and correlations between various in-game stats like Blue Essence and Base HP.

## Project Overview

The project involves extensive data exploration and analysis using Python. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we investigated numerical and categorical attributes of champions, revealing patterns in their gameplay attributes. Additionally, by using statistical analysis and visualization techniques, we explored correlations between champion stats and other in-game metrics, uncovering trends that could be useful in optimizing champion selection and game strategy.

## Key Features

- **Univariate Analysis**: Analysis of numerical attributes like Blue Essence, RP, Base HP, Base Mana, and Release Year.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Correlation matrix to study relationships between key features.
- **Visualization**: Detailed bar charts and heatmaps to represent champion classes, resource types, roles, and their impact on gameplay.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Regression analysis to investigate the relationship between Release Year and Blue Essence Price.

## Skills Applied

- **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing values, corrected data types, and dropped irrelevant columns.
- **Data Manipulation**: Used Pandas to process and organize the dataset, preparing it for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize univariate and bivariate data, showing distributions and correlations.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Applied regression techniques and statistical testing (OLS regression) to identify key relationships between champion stats.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explored champion characteristics by conducting both univariate and bivariate analyses to extract meaningful insights from the data.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: For data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- **Pandas**: Used to load and process the dataset, handling data cleaning and preparation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Used for creating a variety of plots to visualize champion attributes and correlations.
- **Statsmodels**: Used for performing statistical analysis and regression modeling.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mayant/league-of-legends-champions-2024), providing information about League of Legends champions as of 2024, including attributes such as Blue Essence, RP, and release dates.

## Insights and Analysis

- **Champion Stats**: Identified which champions are more powerful based on a combination of key attributes like Blue Essence and RP.
- **Role of Champions**: Examined how roles (e.g., Fighter, Mage, Marksman) correlate with gameplay attributes such as Blue Essence and Base HP.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Discovered significant correlations between in-game stats, particularly the positive relationship between Blue Essence and RP.

## Conclusion

This project offers a comprehensive analysis of League of Legends champions' gameplay attributes. By examining both numerical and categorical features, the analysis provides valuable insights into champion selection strategies and gameplay dynamics. This project showcases how data science techniques can be applied to understand and improve gaming experiences.
